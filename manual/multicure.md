## What is/are the reason(s) to use multi-cure?

If you do not want to waste your time printing the same object over and over again to get perfect print, you should try multi-cure.

Using the new feature you can choose multiple cure times for the same object during plate upload and with single print you can get multiple copy of the same object with different cure times.

Whole print will takes as much as time required for the single plate using highest chosen cure time.

## How to use it?

On the plate add page, there are a button called *advanced*, click and enter whatever cure times you need.

Base cure time for the current profile, also will be added to cure times.
