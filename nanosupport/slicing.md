In this section we can do Slicing, previewing slices, saving slices(layers in PNG format) and sending slices to print.

## Add New Printer

If desired printer wasn't discovered by NanoSupport somehow, New printers can be added manually by entering IP, Port and a Name for the printer. Duplicated IP:Port combination is not allowed.

## Select Resin

By selecting each printer from list, it's resin profiles will be fetched from the printer. Slicing function is not available until selecting at least one resin profile. 

## Slice

## Slice Preview

## Send Slices to Printer

## Download Slices
